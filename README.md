Tired of manually tweaking styles across your project? Theme Generator provides a visual interface to define your core design tokens, ensuring consistency and speeding up your development workflow. Build beautiful, cohesive themes by customizing 7 key areas, see your changes instantly, and export the results in ready-to-use formats.

üöÄ **Key Features**

* üé® **7 Customization Areas:** Fine-tune Fonts, Breakpoints, Colors, Typography, Roundness, Shadows, and Input Styling.
* üëÅÔ∏è **Real-time Preview:** Instantly see how your theme choices affect common UI elements like buttons, inputs, and text styles.
* üí® **Tailwind CSS Ready:** Generate a `theme` object ready to be dropped into your `tailwind.config.js`.
* üç¶ **Raw CSS Output:** Export your theme as clean CSS custom properties for use in any CSS or framework context.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Intuitive Interface:** Easily navigate between customization sections and adjust values with simple controls.
* üíæ **(Planned) Save & Load:** Save your themes locally or in the cloud to reuse or share them later.


‚öôÔ∏è **Customizable Areas**
--------------------------
1.  **Fonts:**
    * Define primary (e.g., body) and secondary (e.g., headings) font families.
    * Specify font weights and styles available in your theme.
    * *(Potential: Set base font size)*
2.  **Breakpoints:**
    * Customize the screen sizes (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`) used for responsive design in Tailwind or media queries.
3.  **Colors:**
    * Create palettes for primary, secondary, accent, neutral, success, warning, and error colors.
    * Define shades for each color (e.g., from 50 to 900) for versatile use.
4.  **Typography:**
    * Configure font sizes, weights, and line heights for different text elements (e.g., headings H1-H6, paragraphs).
    * Ensure consistent vertical rhythm and readability.
5.  **Roundness (Border Radius):**
    * Define a scale for border radius values (e.g., `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `full`) to apply consistent corner rounding to elements like buttons and cards.
6.  **Shadows:**
    * Design a set of box-shadow values (e.g., `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`) for creating depth and elevation effects.
7.  **Input Styling:**
    * Customize the appearance of form inputs, text areas, and selects, including border color, background, focus states, and padding.


üëÅÔ∏è **Real-time Preview**
------------------------
As you adjust settings in any of the 7 customization areas, the preview panel updates instantly. This panel typically showcases:

* **Buttons:** Primary, secondary, and potentially other variants, demonstrating color, roundness, and font usage.
* **Text Elements:** Headings and paragraphs showing typography and color application.
* **Inputs:** Form fields reflecting your input styling choices.
* **Cards/Containers:** Elements displaying background colors, shadows, and roundness.
* **(Potential) Color Palette Swatches:** Direct visualization of your defined colors.

This immediate feedback loop allows you to iterate quickly and make informed design decisions without constantly switching contexts or recompiling assets.


üí® **Export Options**
---------------------
Once you're satisfied with your theme, you can easily export it:

1.  **Tailwind CSS Config:** Generates a JavaScript object structured perfectly for the `theme` or `theme.extend` section of your `tailwind.config.js` file.
2.  **Raw CSS Variables:** Produces a CSS file containing all your theme values defined as custom properties (e.g., `--color-primary: #ff0000;`, `--rounded-md: 0.375rem;`), typically scoped under `:root`. This allows you to use the theme in any project, regardless of whether it uses Tailwind.


ü§î **How It Works**
--------------------
1.  **Navigate:** Select one of the 7 customization areas (Fonts, Colors, etc.) from the sidebar or navigation.
2.  **Customize:** Use the controls (color pickers, sliders, text inputs) within that section to adjust the theme values.
3.  **Preview:** Observe the Real-time Preview panel to see the immediate effect of your changes on sample components.
4.  **Iterate:** Move between sections, refining your theme until you achieve the desired look and feel.
5.  **Export:** Click the "Export" button and choose either the Tailwind CSS config format or the Raw CSS variables format. Copy or download the generated code.
6.  **Integrate:** Paste the generated code into your `tailwind.config.js` or your main CSS file.
